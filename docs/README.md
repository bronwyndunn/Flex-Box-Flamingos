## Flex Box Flamingos

### Background

Flex Box Flamingos is web application tutorial inspired by Flex Box Froggy. It will teach users how to use the CSS flexbox while users try to navigate the flamingos to water. Flex Box Flamingos will be front-end web application, utilizing Javascript and React. Users will input Flexbox code which will manipulate the DOM, allowing users to successfully navigate the flamingos.

### Functionality & MVP  

In Flex Box Flamingos, users will be able to:

- [ ] Toggle the "values" view, which explains the different values for the CSS flexbox property
- [ ] Move the flamingo(s) around the container based on the code they write
- [ ] Move to the next level if they complete that stage

### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be created through React.js and Javascript. There will be a section for instructions, a section that contains a console for users to type their code, and the flamingo area where the elements are manipulated. The console will be an HTML form where the users must type the correct CSS command to move to flamingo to the appropriate area. The users will therefore directly manipulate the DOM with the CSS commands. If the users types the correct command, he/she will be able to move on to the next level.

### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: Setup webpack and create `webpack.config.js`.  Write a basic entry file and root file. Start working on the level 1 HTML form.

**Day 2 and 3**: Continue to work on levels, making the Flexbox actions more complicated. Style the forms as I go. Add React Routes to correspond to the different levels.

**Day $**: Finish CSS styling, add any complex styling. Fix bugs.

## Bonus Features
Depending on how quickly the project goes, I'll think about making the game not just for flexbox also incorporate more CSS styling actions.
